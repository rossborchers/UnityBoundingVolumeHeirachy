Dynamic Unity 3d BVH - 3d Bounding Volume Hierarchy.

Modified from David Jeske's [SimpleScene](https://github.com/jeske/SimpleScene/tree/master/SimpleScene/Util/ssBVH)

### About

This is a 3d Bounding Volume Hiearchy implementation for Unity in C#. It is used for sorting objects that occupy 
volume and answering geometric queries about them; such as ray, box, and sphere intersection.

It includes an efficient algorithm for incrementally re-optimizing the BVH when contained objects move. This variation works in Unity and supports GameObjects.

For more information about what a BVH is, and about how to use this code, see David's CodeProject article:

### Notable Modifications

- Supports GameObjects through a custom implementation of IBVHNodeAdapter (BVHGameObjectAdapter). Uses child renderers bounds to calculate bounds. Could be easily swapped out for any other bounds calculation. See BVHGameObjectAdaptor.GetBounds.
- BVHHelper provides a radial node traversal test to be used with Traverse().
- Code has been refactored to be _closer_ to the .NET naming conventions.
- Includes some tests that can be used as a starting reference.
